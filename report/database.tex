\section{Dataset}
We consider the dataset from file \texttt{Elec\_30\_11\_train.xlsx} that contain measurements of 
electricity consumption (in kW) and the Outdoor Air Temperature (OAT, in degree Fahrenheit) for one 
building. Temperature measurements in degrees Celsius are also presented in the dataset but as they 
are linearly related to the measurements in degrees Fahrenheit, these measurements are of no 
interest. Measurements are done every 15 minutes from the 1$^{st}$ of January 2010 at 1:15am until 
the 29$^{th}$ of November 2010 at 23:45pm which correspond to a total of 32059 measurements with 
no missing data in the dataset. The aim of this study is to predict the electricity consumption 
for the day of the 30$^{st}$ of November.\\
