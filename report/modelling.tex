 \item Check linearity, seasonality
 \item Holt-Winters : not good method for this high frequency dataset

\subsection{SARIMA}

\red{\begin{itemize}
 \item results from auto.arima
 \item talk about problem of time needed to compute ARIMA -> use fourier
 \item without seasonality -> very bad results !!
 \item without covariates  -> very bad results !! + show new seasons not seen in 'power' (8,12,16 hours period) -> usefull to use it ?? with fourier, we could add several periods 
 \item with covariates -> no improvements. start without to try and add at end
 \item with seasonality: very long so can not do grid-search
\end{itemize}}
